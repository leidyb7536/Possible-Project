<h1>CHILL SESH</h1>

<p>One day I was just chilling with the homies. It was really fun but also pretty chill. We cruised my pad and just hung out. Suddenly Jack said
 "Gabapentin is used in the treatment of neuropathic pain; anxiety; alcohol withdrawal; postherpetic neuralgia; bipolar disorder (and more),
 and belongs to the drug class gamma-aminobutyric acid analogs. Risk cannot be ruled out during pregnancy. Gabapentin 300 mg is not a controlled substance under the Controlled Substance Act (CSA)."
 We all clapped and realized he was truly my father from another timeline.</p>
