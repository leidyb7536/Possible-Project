<p>Burgers are nais, smooth hair is nais, my house is nais, i am nais, games are nais, snakes are nais, Mark Whalberg is nais, TV is nais, phones are nais, beds are nais, lightbulbs are nais, skyscrapers are nais, cars are nais, Mars is nais, stars are nais. This is pointless there is an unlimited amount of things that are nais. I will never be able to finish the list because the universe is endless and we are bad a speck in this enormous, depressing, uinverse nothing we do matters.</p>
